===============
### Rewrite [ShapeUp](https://github.com/BASISPhoenix/11-20-ShapeUp) to ensure proper encapsulation.

## Objectives
- Understand how to abstract an objectâ€™s internal details, by encapsulating its fields
- Be able to implement a class with *proper encapsulation*

## Assignment

Every class should be placed into its own file!  

In the directory "src", you will find five files:
- ShapeUp.java: Main Program - **DO NOT** modify this file 
- Point.java: Modify the Point class you created on 11/20
- Line.java: A Line object represents a line defined by a pair of Points
- Circle.java: A Circle object represents a circle defined by a center point and a radius
- Rectangle.java: A Rectangle object represents a rectangle defined by an origin point (bottom left corner), plus width and height
